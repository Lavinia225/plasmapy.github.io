A part of the PlasmaPy's charter is to promote open-source software for all of the 
plasma community, and not just `plasmapy`.  We feel the entire community benefits 
when there are multiple efforts trying to build functionality for all aspects
of the plasma field.  As such, we want to promote all ongoing efforts in the
community.  This page displays all ongoing projects that have requested to be
shown.  If you want to add your projected here and increase your visibility, please
submit a request **here** (I will make a google form for this).

The packages are divided into two groups:

[**Affiliated Packages:**](#Affiliated-Packages)

: These packages have had interoperability with `plasmapy` designed into them. 


[**Community Packages:**](#Community-Packages)

: These packages do not have interoperability with `plasmapy`, but do provide
  crucial functionality to aspects of the plasma field that `plasmapy` may not
  or can not provide.
